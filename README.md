# Fireworks Mania - Mod Tools
This is the place to start when creating mods for Fireworks Mania.

# Getting started
Ok lets get started boys and girls - read on to get started.


## 1. Getting Unity
So the first thing you need is Unity. 

> If you have no idea how Unity works, I will suggest you find some getting started tutorial on YouTube (Insert link?).

Go and get the "Unity Hub": https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download

When Unity Hub installed on your machine you can install you are ready to install Unity.

> I'm not sure how this will work in the future yet when it comes to different versions of Unity, for now you need a specific version.

You need Unity *2021.1.19*. Go to this link and click the green "Unity Hub" button on that version. This should make Unity Hub download this version.

## 3. Install dependencies

### Git
If you get an error saying something with "Git" when you try to add some of the below dependencies, its because you don't have Git installed on your computer.
You can get git from here, install that and restart Unity and Unity Hub: https://git-scm.com/
