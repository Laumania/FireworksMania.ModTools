# Fireworks Mania - Mod Tools
This is the place to start when creating mods for Fireworks Mania.

# Getting started
Ok lets get started boys and girls - read on to get started.


## 1. Getting Unity
So the first thing you need is Unity. 

> If you have no idea how Unity works, I will suggest you find some getting started tutorial on YouTube (Insert link?).

Go and get the "Unity Hub": https://store.unity.com/download-nuo

When Unity Hub installed on your machine you can install you are ready to install Unity.

> I'm not sure how this will work in the future yet when it comes to different versions of Unity, for now you need a specific version.

You need Unity *2021.1.15*. Go to this link and click the green "Unity Hub" button on that version. This should make Unity Hub download this version.
